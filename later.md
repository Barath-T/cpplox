# Intermediate Representation (IR)
    - control flow graphs
    - static single-assignment
    - continuation-passing style
    - three-address code
    
# Optimisation
    - constant propagation
    - common subexpression elimination
    - loop invariant code motion
    - global value numbering
    - strength reduction
    - scalar replacement of aggregates
    - dead code elimination
    - loop unrolling
